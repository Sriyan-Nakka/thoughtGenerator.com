# Random Thought Generator

Welcome to Random Thought Generator! Where you can generate random thoughts and share with your friends!

Now maybe some people may be wondering like why this repo was not released after the blog post on my Blog website about this project was released, and the reason is that I was lazy LOL

I followed a simplistic UI design for this project just like my other projects, the best example being my Greeting Card Generator which also comes under the 'Customizations' group of projects...

This project uses a Firebase database consisting of 75 thoughts which are mostly related to education because the place where I got these thoughts from is an educational place AKA school. This project was also deployed using Firebase, but GitHub Pages is still available! Hope you like it! :)
